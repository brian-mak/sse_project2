    <h3><strong>Remarks:</strong></h3>
    <p>Remember to start with a warm-up and finish with a cool-down stretching routine. Rest for about 60-90 seconds between sets to allow for recovery. Gradually increase the weight as you progress to continue challenging your muscles. Make sure to maintain proper form throughout each exercise to prevent injury and maximize muscle growth.</p>
